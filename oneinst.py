     ###----------PARAMETERS----------###
    ### to be determined / chosen beforehand
    
    ### GENERAL ### 
    
    ### N_SIDE: integer. the number of bats per side in a square lattice - the total population size will be N_SIDE^2
    ### TIME_RESOLUTION: float. Time resolution, i.e time (in s) represented over 1 iteration
    ###     simulation time step.allows to keep a sensible ratio between time in
    ###     in seconds & time in time steps in the simulation.
    ###     Time (in s) = TIME_RESOLUTION * time (in simulation time steps).
    ### SIMULATION_DURATION: integer. duration of the simulation, i.e. number of iterations
    ###     over which the simulation must be ran.
    ### CORNER_INDIVIDUAL_POSITION : 1x2 list with float numbers, the 'corner' position from which the rest of the lattice is built
    ### IID_ON_AXE : float, inter individual distance on the axis 
    
    ### INDIVIDUAL ###
    
    ### MOVEMENT_ANGLE: float. Angle (in degrees), between the x-axis and the 
    ###     direction of the movement of the agent. 
    ###     Only values between 0 & 360Â°C are accepted.
    ### FLIGHT_SPEED: float. Flight speed (m/s) of the agent.
    ### CALL_DURATION: float. length of call, in seconds
    ### INTER_PULSE_INTERVAL: Inter-pulse interval of the agent, i.e. time interval 
    ###     between each call initiated.
    ### HEARING_THRESHOLD: lowest sound pressure level a bat can hear (dB SPL)
    ### SOURCE_LEVEL : the sound pressure level of a bat call (dB SPL @ 10cm)
    ### ALPHA : atmospheric absorption of sound at the call frequencies
    ### speed of sound : float. velocity of sound propagation in m/s
