#Quantifying Potential Sensory Interference in Bat Aggregations

This repository contains the supplementary data of the research project report "Quantifying Potential Sensory Interference in Bat Aggregations", supervised by Thejasvi Beleyur and Dr. Holger Goerlitz.

**Summary of the report**

>Navigation in complex environments requires accurate and quick response to perceived sensory cues. This challenge is increased when active sensing is the primary source of information for probing surroundings. A typical example is echolocating bats, in particular when they fly in groups. They face multiple issues on a sensory level, due to echolocation jamming. In close-quarter flight, an individual bat encounters direct sensory interference from its conspecifics. Those emit echolocation calls of similar frequency that overlap in time with the individual's own calls and echoes. In order to cope with this interference, bats adopt various strategies, such as calling less often, louder, or altering call frequencies. However, it is still poorly understood to which extent these tactics enable bats to alleviate sonar interference that arises in situations of relatively close-quarter group flight. With the aim of quantifying the impact of change in inter-pulse interval, we built an individual-based model with groups of flying and echolocating bats. We show that the alteration of inter-pulse interval can lead to an adjustment of the theoretical levels of sensory interference, with an additional effect of population density. We hope that this model will help favour the use of individual-based models to further our understanding of sensory interference that bats are able to overcome in the context of bat aggregations.
