    #0 N_SIDE: integer. the number of bats per side in a square lattice - the total population size will be N_SIDE^2
    #1 TIME_RESOLUTION: float. Time resolution, i.e time (in s) represented over 1 iteration
    #     simulation time step.allows to keep a sensible ratio between time in
    #     in seconds & time in time steps in the simulation.
    #     Time (in s) = TIME_RESOLUTION * time (in simulation time steps).
    #2 SIMULATION_DURATION: integer. duration of the simulation, i.e. number of iterations
    #3     over which the simulation must be ran.
    #4 CORNER_INDIVIDUAL_POSITION : 1x2 list with float numbers, the 'corner' position from which the rest of the lattice is built
    #5 IID_ON_AXE : float, inter individual distance on the axis 
       
    #6 MOVEMENT_ANGLE: float. Angle (in degrees), between the x-axis and the 
    #     direction of the movement of the agent. 
    #     Only values between 0 & 360Â°C are accepted.
    #7 FLIGHT_SPEED: float. Flight speed (m/s) of the agent.
    #8 CALL_DURATION: float. length of call, in seconds
    #9 INTER_PULSE_INTERVAL: Inter-pulse interval of the agent, i.e. time interval 
    #     between each call initiated.
    #10 HEARING_THRESHOLD: lowest sound pressure level a bat can hear (dB SPL)
    #11 SOURCE_LEVEL : the sound pressure level of a bat call (dB SPL @ 10cm)
    #12 ALPHA : atmospheric absorption of sound at the call frequencies
    #13 speed of sound : float. velocity of sound propagation in m/s
